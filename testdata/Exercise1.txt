friendly than others. Your tasks are: 
1. visit all the digital atlases listed above, 
2. choose one that you think is useful and one that you do not think is useful (for 
whatever reasons), and 
3. create a map using each chosen atlas. 
 
REPORT 
Make a one or two page report that includes 1) a brief description on what makes you think 
that the atlases chosen in Task 2 are useful or not useful and 2) the two maps created in Task 
3. Submit the report on our BILDA website by Monday, September 3, 11:59 pm.
